# L-hidden-layers-Neural-Network-with-binary-output
An example of a multilayer neural network made from scratch with python

*this neural network only gives binary results

*thre datasets are used as an example: iris data set,Titanic data set and data_banknote_authentication data set.

*the titanic dataset is already processed(is in the dataset folder), 
the processing of the data was carried out with this code: https://github.com/d1sd41n/pre-processing-the-Titanic-Dataset-data-science-example-/blob/master/pre%20processing%20the%20data.ipynb
